<div class="section" id="tcga">
<h2>TCGA<a class="headerlink" href="#tcga" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>TCGA somatic mutations (mc3.v0.2.8 version) were downloaded from
(<a class="reference external" href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas">https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas</a>).
We then grouped mutations according to their patient’s cancer type into
32 different cohorts. Additionally, we kept somatic mutations
passing the somatic filtering from TCGA (i.e., column FILTER
== “PASS”).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pcawg">
<h2>PCAWG<a class="headerlink" href="#pcawg" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PCAWG somatic mutations were downloaded from the International Cancer
Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal
(<a class="reference external" href="https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/">https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/</a>).
Note that only ICGC samples can be freely downloaded from this site, the
TCGA portion of the callsets is controlled data. Instructions on how to
obtain them can be found in the same webpage.</p>

Sequencing (WGS) cohorts uploaded in cBioPortal that were not part of
any other projects included in the analysis (i.e., TCGA, PCAWG, St. Jude
or HARTWIG) were downloaded on 2018/09/01 (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbioportal.org/datasets">http://www.cbioportal.org/datasets</a>).
We then created cohorts following the next criteria:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Cohorts with a limited number of samples (i.e., lower than 30 samples) associated to cancer types with extensive representation (such as Breast cancer, Prostate cancer or Colorectal adenocarcinoma) across the compendium of cohorts were removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Samples were uniquely mapped into one single cohort. If the same sample was originally included in two cohorts, we removed the sample from one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Samples not sequenced from human cancer biopsies were discarded (cell lines, xenografts, normal tissue, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>When patient information was available, only one sample from the same patient was selected. The criteria to prioritize samples from the same patient was: WXS over WGS; untreated over treated, primary over metastasis or relapse and, finally, by alphabetical order. When there is no patient information we assume that all patients have only one sample in the cohort.</p></li>
<li><p>When sequencing platform information was available, samples from the same study but with different sequencing platforms were further subclassified into WXS and WGS datasets (only if the resulting cohorts fulfilled the requirements herein described; otherwise, the samples were discarded).</p></li>
<li><p>When variant calling information was available, samples from the same cohort and sequencing type were further classified according to their calling algorithm (VarScan, MuTect, etc.). If the resulting cohorts for each subclass fulfilled the requirements herein described, the samples were included;otherwise, the samples were discarded. When variant calling information was not available we assumed that all the samples went through the same pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>When treatment information was available, samples from the same cohort, sequencing type, calling algorithm were further classified according to their treatment status (i.e, treated versus untreated). If the resulting cohorts from the subclassification fulfilled the requirements herein described, the samples were included;otherwise, the samples were discarded. When information was not available we assumed that samples had not been treated.</p></li>
<li><p>When biopsy information was available, samples from the same cohort, sequencing type, calling algorithm, treatment status were further classified according to their biopsy type (i.e, primary, relapse or metastasis). If the resulting datasets from the subclassification fulfilled the requirements herein described, the samples were included; otherwise, the samples were discarded. When information was not available we assumed that the biopsy type of the sample was primary.</p></li>
